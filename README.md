This repository demonstrates a common error in Lua programming: improper handling of nil values.  The `bug.lua` file contains code that throws an error because a nil value is passed to a function that doesn't handle it gracefully. The `bugSolution.lua` demonstrates how to prevent this issue by using better error checking or alternative methods.
